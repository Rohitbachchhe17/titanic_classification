This dataset requires us to predict 'What sorts of people were likely to survive the titanic shipreck?'. This is a Classification problem and I used the following three classification models.

1. Support Vector Machine
2. Logistic Regression
3. Random Forest Classifier


## Titanic-classification

A classification approach to the machine learning Titanic survival challenge on Kaggle.Data visualisation, data preprocessing and different algorithms are tested and explained in form of Jupyter Notebooks.# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers including their age, gender, ticket class, fare, and whether they survived or not.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to build a classification model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not based on the given features.

## Model

We employ various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, etc., to train our model and select the best performing one.

## Evaluation

We evaluate the performance of our model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we visualize the results using confusion matrices and ROC curves.
